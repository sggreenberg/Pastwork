more normalized means more tables
denormalized for performance (say to get rid of people when I hadn't normalized)--typically involves cleanish data though
by def 2nf implies 1nf
primary key can be made of more than one attribute
dependency diagram
functional dependency: everything must be functionally dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key so help me codd.[bcnf]
3 types of anomalies: update, insertion, deletion (lame)
all relational tables satisfy the 1nf requirements (primary key, and no repeating groups (comes from 1970 kobal) : writing same as above)
part of data cleaning is eliminating duplicates.
bcnf is because there is a step between 3rd and 4th
Will learn common table expressions
