ER diagrams are like blueprints to databases
Chen diagrams are to go hand in glove with codds relational model
In real world one submits er diagram and collegues all debate it
	If I have many to many relationship I would have at most 3 tables
		For between students and courses (a student can take many courses and courses have many students)
			I would have a Students table, Courses table and a bridge table
				bridge table contains st least the primary key of students and courses table
attributes describe entities and typically cannot be defined even further
Attribute/entity/
required attribute must have a value (check if null)
singlevalued or multivalued & simple or composite
if cardinality of attribute has minimum of zero it is optional; if it has a minimum of 1 it is required
what happens if an entity needs to go over the maximum value of 
code to delete dependent rows
crows feet optional is depicted by a line with a circle on it ( -0- )
Assignment 2 use sql-irc
how to round:
SELECT PriceID, ROUND(ST_High,2) AS Roundedstocktothenearestpenny
	FROM StockData
	WHERE ST_High > 130
5 aggregates: AVERAGE, MAXIMUM,MINIMUM,COUNT,SUM

What if in order to write sql queries i write the functions first (in caps lock) then write the comments and names/aliases after (without caps-lock and maybe with regex)

/*
List each ticker symbol and the average daily trade volume for that stock. Order the list from highest to least daily trade volume.
*/
SELECT TS, AVG(V) AS AV
	FROM SD
GROUP BY TS
:1,6 s/ TS/ TickerSymbol/g
:1,6 s/V/Volume/g
:1,6 s/ AV/ AverageV/g
:1,6 s/ SD / StockData /g

ORDER BY is only place to use aggregate
ORDER BY always goes last.
Cartesian product: each row in one table combined with every row in another table

/* Create a Toys table (ToyID, ToyName
CREATE TABLE Toys
(ToyID INT PRIMARY KEY)

cross-join gives cartesian product
What is a stored procedure is like a defined function
faster and makes things premanant
never put exec statement in the stored procedure (write it seperately or at least put an end)
